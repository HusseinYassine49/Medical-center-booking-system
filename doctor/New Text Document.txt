Since you're using a Windows environment (with XAMPP), you won't be using crontab as it's a Unix-based utility. Instead, you can use Task Scheduler to run your PHP script at a specified time. Here's how you can set up Task Scheduler to run your PHP script daily:

Step 1: Create a Batch File
Create a batch file that runs your PHP script. For example, create a file named send_confirmation_email.bat with the following content:

bat
Copy code
@echo off
"C:\xampp\php\php.exe" "C:\xampp\htdocs\Medical-center-booking-system\send_confirmation_email.php"
Replace C:\xampp\php\php.exe with the path to your PHP executable and C:\xampp\htdocs\Medical-center-booking-system\send_confirmation_email.php with the path to your PHP script.

Step 2: Schedule the Task
Open Task Scheduler:

Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter.
Create a New Basic Task:

In the Task Scheduler window, click on Create Basic Task in the right-hand pane.
Give your task a name (e.g., "Send Appointment Confirmation Emails") and click Next.
Set the Trigger:

Choose Daily and click Next.
Set the start date and time for when you want the task to run and click Next.
Set the Action:

Choose Start a program and click Next.
In the Program/script field, browse to the batch file you created earlier (e.g., C:\path\to\send_confirmation_email.bat) and click Next.
Finish:

Review your settings and click Finish to create the task.
Summary
By creating a batch file and using Task Scheduler, you can run your PHP script daily on a Windows system, ensuring that patients receive a confirmation email one day before their appointments.
